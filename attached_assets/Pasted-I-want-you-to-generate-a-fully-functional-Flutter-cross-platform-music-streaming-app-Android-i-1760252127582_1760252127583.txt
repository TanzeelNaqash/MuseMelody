I want you to generate a fully functional **Flutter cross-platform music streaming app** (Android, iOS, Web) with the following specifications. **All data must come from real sources** (no placeholders or fake data):

1. **YouTube Integration**:
   - Use the **YouTube Data API** to search and fetch songs, artists, albums, and playlists.
   - Embed videos using the **YouTube IFrame Player API** for playback.
   - Allow switching to **audio-only mode**, hiding the video while the audio continues.
   - Support play, pause, skip, seek, shuffle, repeat, volume, playback speed.
   - Trending playlists and recommended songs must reflect **real YouTube data**.

2. **Offline / Local Support**:
   - Detect and play music files stored on the user’s device.
   - Allow users to **download songs** for offline playback (local storage or device files).
   - On Web, allow users to **upload their own songs**, which will be stored in the backend for playback.

3. **UI / UX**:
   - Mimic the **YouTube Music app UI** as closely as possible:
     - Home feed, trending charts, playlists, library, search.
     - Bottom navigation bar: Home, Explore, Library, Profile.
     - Smooth animations for screen transitions, song playback, and controls.
     - Light/dark mode support.
   - Implement **responsive design for Web**:
     - On small devices, show an **“Install App” prompt** with a PWA install link.

4. **Lyrics Support**:
   - Fetch and display lyrics for the currently playing song using a **real lyrics API** (e.g., Lyrics.ovh, Genius API).
   - Support scroll-synced lyrics where possible.
   - Show “No lyrics found” if lyrics are unavailable.

5. **Additional Features**:
   - Search bar with **real-time suggestions** from YouTube Data API.
   - Queue management: add/remove/reorder songs.
   - History and recently played tracks.
   - Playlist creation/editing (local and YouTube playlists).
   - Background playback, notifications, and lock-screen controls on mobile.
   - Smooth animations for album art, play/pause buttons, and screen transitions.

6. **Backend Support (Web Upload & Storage)**:
   - Minimal backend using Node.js/Express + MongoDB or Firebase.
   - Store uploaded songs, user playlists, and metadata.
   - Provide download/playback URLs for uploaded songs.
   - Offline songs should sync to local storage where possible.

7. **Flutter Packages / Plugins**:
   - `youtube_player_iframe` for embedded YouTube playback.
   - `just_audio` or `audio_service` for local/offline playback.
   - `provider` or `riverpod` for state management.
   - `http` / `dio` for API calls.
   - `flutter_animate` or `rive` for animations.
   - `url_launcher` for Web “Install App” prompts.

8. **Requirements**:
   - Fully responsive, cross-platform.
   - Modular Flutter code with separation of concerns.
   - Well-commented code for all major functions.
   - Handle YouTube API errors, rate limits, and network failures gracefully.
   - Ensure **all music metadata, playback, and lyrics** are fetched from **real sources** (YouTube API and lyrics API).

9. **Deliverables**:
   - Complete Flutter project structure for Android, iOS, and Web.
   - Instructions to run and deploy on all platforms.
   - Include an example `.env` file for API keys and backend config.

**Goal:** The app should function like **YouTube Music**:
- Streaming from YouTube with audio-only mode.
- Offline/local playback.
- Upload music on Web.
- Lyrics support.
- Playlists, queue, history.
- Full animations and responsive UI.
- Install app prompt for mobile Web.
